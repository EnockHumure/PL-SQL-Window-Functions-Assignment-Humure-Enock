##  1. Business Problem Definition 

### Business Context

**Company:** Inock Rwandan Coffee Shop  
**Industry:** Hospitality & Retail Coffee  
**Department:** Sales Analytics  
**Locations:** 3 branches in Rwanda (Kigali, Huye, Musanze)  
**Operation:** Daily coffee shop serving local and tourist customers

### Data Challenge
The coffee shop lacks analytical capabilities to compare performance across branches, 
understand customer behavior patterns, and optimize product offerings. Current manual reporting provides basic totals but no comparative or trend analysis.

### Expected Outcome
Data-driven insights for inventory optimization, customer segmentation, and
targeted marketing strategies to increase revenue by 15% in the next quarter.

### Success Criteria (5 Measurable Goals)

1. **Identify top 3 products per branch** using `RANK()` - for inventory optimization
2. **Calculate running weekly sales totals** using `SUM() OVER()` - for revenue tracking
3. **Analyze week-over-week growth** using `LAG()` - for trend identification
4. **Segment customers into spending quartiles** using `NTILE(4)` - for marketing targeting
5. **Compute 4-week moving averages** using `AVG() OVER()` - for sales forecasting

## üóÉÔ∏è 2. Database Schema 

### Entity-Relationship Diagram


---[drawing schema using draw io]`screenshot/database schema.drawio`

    ![screen shot of er diagram](screenshot/drawing of schema.png)
* this is the screen shot in case the draw io is not working 

Primary Keys: customer_id, product_id, sale_id
Foreign Keys: customer_id references Customers, product_id references Products

### Table: customers

## this will help us to do this 3 essential thing
1.**Stores customer demographic data and branch association

2.**Used to analyze customer distribution across locations

3.**Supports customer segmentation for marketing campaigns

**[creating table of customers and insert values](creating tables/create & insert  into customers.sql)** - customers 

.. ***Create customers table for Inock Rwandan Coffee Shop
.. **This table stores all customer information and their branch preferences

![customers  Results](screenshot/pl customer table.png)** - creating customer result

### Table: products
* Maintains product catalog with pricing information
* Enables category-based sales analysis
* Supports inventory optimization decisions

![creating table of products and insert values](creating tables/create & insert into products table.sql)** - customers 

-- Create products table - stores coffee shop menu items
-- Used for product performance analysis and inventory management
![products  Results](screenshot/pl product table.png)** - creating product result

### Table: sales
Core table for all analytical queries
Contains foreign keys to connect customer and product data
Stores temporal data for trend analysis and growth calculations

**[creating table of sales values](creating tables/create & insert into sales.sql)** - customers 

--Create sales table - records all customer transactions
-- Links customers to products with date and amount details
![sales   Results](screenshot/pl sales table.png)** - creating customer result

            ### 1. Ranking Query
-- Identify top 3 performing products in each branch
-- Uses RANK() to position products by revenue within each location

**[Ranking functions query](queries/ranking window function.sql)** - Top products analysis


* PARTITION BY creates separate rankings for each branch
* RANK() assigns positions based on total sales revenue
* Helps managers focus on location-specific bestsellers
![Ranking results](screenshot/ranking window function.png)** - Branch performance ranking
            ###2. Aggregate Query

-- Calculate running totals and moving averages of weekly sales
-- Demonstrates window functions with frame specifications

**[Aggregate functions query](queries/agregate function.sql)** - Sales trends calculation


* ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING calculates cumulative sum from beginning
* ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW creates 4-week moving window
* Provides trend analysis and performance tracking capabilities
![Aggregate results](screenshot/aggregate window  function.png)** - Running totals output

            ### 3.navigation window functions

-- Navigation Functions: Week-over-Week Growth Analysis
-- Uses LAG() to compare current week with previous week sales
-- Calculates growth percentages for trend identification

**[Navigation Functions Implementation](queries/navigation function.sql)** - Week-over-week growth analysis  

* LAG() function accesses previous week's data for comparison
* Growth percentage calculation shows performance changes week-to-week
* Helps identify successful periods and seasonal patterns for planning
![Navigation Results](screenshot/navigation function.png)** - Growth percentage calculations

            ### 4. distribution window functions

-- Distribution Functions: Customer Spending Segmentation  
-- Uses NTILE(4) to divide customers into 4 equal spending groups
-- Segments customers by total spending for targeted marketing

**[Distribution Functions Implementation](queries/distribution functions.sql)** - Customer segmentation by spending  

1.NTILE(4) function creates 4 equal customer groups based on spending
2.Quartile 1 represents VIP customers needing retention focus
3.Quartile 4 identifies customers who may need reactivation campaigns

![Distribution results](screenshot/distribution window function .png)
### Step 4: Results Analysis 

### Descriptive Analysis (What Happened?)

1. Kigali branch contributed 48% of total revenue, followed by Huye (32%) and Musanze at kinigi (20%)
2.Coffee products dominated sales, accounting for 68% of total revenue
3. Top 25% of customers generated 62% of total revenue

### Diagnostic Analysis (Why does it happen?)

1.Kigali's central location attracts higher corporate and tourist traffic
2. Strong local coffee culture drives higher coffee product sales
3. Week 5 growth correlated with university graduation ceremonies in  huye (butare)
4. Regular customers and tourist groups show higher average spending

### Prescriptive Analysis (What Next?)

1. Increase coffee product stock by 35% across all branches, with focus on Rwanda urwunge rwanyabihu capucino
2.Implement loyalty program targeting Quartile 1 customers with personalized offers
3. Replicate Week 5 promotional strategies during similar seasonal periods
4. Consider new branch locations in high-potential areas identified through customer geographic analysis

# PL/SQL Window Functions Assignment

## Project Overview
This project focuses on practicing and applying **Oracle SQL Window Functions** to solve real-world database problems.  
The assignment demonstrates how functions like `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK` can be used to analyze data in business scenarios.  
Screenshots and examples have been combined with both the **queries and their results** shown together for easy understanding.
